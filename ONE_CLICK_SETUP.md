## ðŸ“± How to Use

2. **Add the server configuration** (copy the JSON from `mcp_config.json`)
3. **Share your Google Sheets** with the service account email
4. **Start using the tools!**

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

### **"I can't find the JSON file"**
- Check your Downloads folder
- Look for a file ending in `.json`
- It was downloaded when you created the service account key

### **"I don't know what to copy"**
- Open your JSON file in a text editor
- Look for lines like `"project_id": "something"`
- Copy the value between the quotes (not the quotes themselves)

### **"The test failed"**
- Make sure you copied all the values correctly
- Check that you didn't add extra spaces
- Verify the `cwd` path is correct

### **"I can't access my Google Sheets"**
- Share your Google Sheets with the service account email
- Give it "Editor" permissions
- The email is in your JSON file under `client_email`

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Save your JSON file** - You'll need it again if you reinstall
- **Keep it secure** - Don't share your JSON file with others
- **Test first** - Always run `python3 test_server.py` before using
- **Start small** - Try with one Google Sheet first

**That's it! You now have a powerful Google Sheets AI assistant!** ðŸš€
